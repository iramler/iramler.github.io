Topics include the description of data with numerical summaries and graphs, the production of data through sampling and experimental design, techniques of making inferences from data such as confidence intervals, and hypothesis tests for both categorical and quantitative data. The course includes an introduction to computer analysis of data with a statistical computing package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStat 213 - Applied Regression Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\nA continuation of Statistics 113 intended for students in the physical, social or behavioral sciences. Topics include simple and multiple linear regression, model diagnostics and testing, residual analysis, transformations, indicator variables, variable selection techniques, logistic regression, and analysis of variance. Most methods assume use of a statistical computing package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStat/Data 234 - Foundations of Data Science\n\n\n\n\n\nAn introduction to fundamental data science concepts using modern statistical programming languages and software. The course assumes no prior knowledge of programming but a familiarity with basic statistics is required. The course focuses on building essential data science skills such as data manipulation and visualization, basics of programming, string manipulation, and modern data sources (such as web and databases). Emphasis will be placed on building skills applicable to large scale projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStat 313 - Advanced Linear Models\n\n\n\n\n\nIn previous Statistics courses, normality and independence of errors (residuals) were fundamental assumptions of the models encountered. However, in the real world, things are not always normal or independent. This course will cover more advanced techniques such as generalized linear models (including Poisson regression and Logistic regression) and multilevel models so that students can develop statistical models in a wider range of real-world situations. Pre-req: STAT-213. Offered as scheduling allows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStat/Data 489 & 498 - Senior Capstone Projects\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery student pursuing a major in Statistics is required to complete an one-unit research project during their senior year. Data Science majors either complete the the capstone project or may replace it with an approved “Experiential Learning” activity. (This is typically a full-time internship or summer research experience related to Data Science)\nHere are a few recent student projects that I have mentored.\n\nApplying the Histogram of Oriented Gradients Algorithm for Detecting Grass Lay Direction\nApplying Generalized Linear Models to Five Peruvian Army-Ant Following Birds\nUsing Interactive Graphics to Visualize Evening Grosbeak Movement and Migration Patterns\nIntroduction to Survival Analysis Modeling Medical Time-to-Event Data Using R Software Packages\nDissimilarity Measures for Probability Distributions with an Application to Music Artist Classification\nScraping and Analyzing NCAA Data with Applications to Liberty League Volleyball\nExploring the Potential of Data Analysis and Machine Learning in the Beer Industry: A Study of IPA Styles\nUsing Logistic Lasso Regression and Ego Networks to Model Synergy in Clash Royale\nModeling St. Lawrence County COVID-19 Cases"

    "text": "I joined the Department of Mathematics, Computer Science, and Statistics at St. Lawrence in winter of 2009 after finishing my PhD in Statistics from Iowa State University. My dissertation work, under the guidance of Dr. Ranjan Maitra, involved improving cluster analysis methods for noisy data and for data constrained to lie on the surface of a multi-dimensional sphere.\nMy current interests (and projects) focus on applied statistics (& data science) and statistics (& data science) education. In particular, recently most of my work has involved analyzing competitive video game data called “esports” (with a focus on the game League of Legends) and building statistics & data science education materials for the SCORE Network.\nI also regularly teach many of St. Lawrence’s Statistics courses (e.g., Intro Stats, Foundations of Data Science, Regression Analysis) and have student research projects with applications in sports, video games, environmental science, modern literature, and much more!"
